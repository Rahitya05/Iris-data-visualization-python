# Iris-data-visualization-python
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks for visualizing the Iris dataset using a variety of plots. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, and this project aims to explore and visualize its features to gain insights into the relationships between sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width across different species of Iris flowers using python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Features
**Pair Plot**: Visualizes the relationships between all pairs of features in the dataset. This plot helps in understanding how different features correlate with each other and how species are distributed across these features.

**Scatter Plot**: Shows the relationship between specific features, color-coded by species. Useful for examining how sepal length and width or petal length and width vary by species.

**Pie Chart**: Displays the frequency distribution of different species in the dataset. It helps in understanding the proportion of each species within the dataset.

**KDE Plot**: Provides a smooth estimate of the distribution of features, visualizing how features such as sepal length and sepal width or petal length and petal width are distributed within each species.

**Joint Plot**: Combines scatter plots and marginal histograms (or KDE plots) to show the relationship between two features and their individual distributions.
